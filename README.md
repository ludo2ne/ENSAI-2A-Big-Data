## Edit a Lab

Labs notebooks are in `docs/lab`.
They are in format `.ipynb`, to edit them two main ways:
* import in Jupyter, modify, export and update in this repository
* install quarto and use : `quarto convert <filename.ipynb>`
  * it convert an `.ipynb` file to a `.qmd` file easily readable
  * once your done, use the same command applied to qmd file: `quarto convert <filename.qmd>` to get a `.ipynb` file
