Lessons and Labs created by [Rémi Pépin](https://github.com/HealerMikado/panorama_big_data_2021){target="_blank"} and [Arthur Katossky](https://github.com/katossky/panorama-bigdata){target="_blank"}

## Objectives

- Understand the basics of computation in the real world, the bottlenecks and how to solve them
- Understand the basics of cloud computing and how to use AWS (or SSP Cloud)
- Get familiar with big data technologies and the most common paradigm
- Learn how to use Spark for data exploration on data at rest or streamed data, and how to use some basics ML algorithm on big data
